# Boids

[boids.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84fe1981-549e-4702-8b92-d88ba274079b)

This is my naive implementations of 2D Boids(Bird-oid objects) flocking simulation using the SFML library. 

Originally this project was the final for my CSCI200 course, but I hope to add some more parellelism and improve the algorithm as I learn more.
